City Map
=============

To bring together what has been covered, we'll now create a project "City Map"

This project will use the Chicago Data sets we loaded in PostGIS.

While you can use other data, it will be easier to follow if you load the provided data.
      
Skills
===================

To this point, we have covered
      
1. Preparing GIS Data
2. Loading GIS Data
3. Presenting GIS Data

We'll now bring these together to create our project.

We'll also cover styling our GeoServer layers.
